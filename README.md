# Code-Thesis-Economics
I created this code in order to analyse data of LIS database and 
produce graphs for my master's thesis "Inequality decomposition:
a comparison between Italy and Austria". The thesis can be found
here https://github.com/Michele405/Code-Thesis-Economics/blob/main/Thesis%20ECON%20REVISED.pdf
